***This is my first full fledged website***


This is a rough implementation of one of the projects we are doing internally.
Here is the design that I was looking to replicate. https://humming-brand.webflow.io/
Would welcome any feedbacks.

Key Features that I was looking to cover 
- the sticky mennu
- Cards section
- the big footer

Things not covered but will cover down the line
- No hover states have been intentionally added.
- Need to make sure it's responsive for all device sizes.
